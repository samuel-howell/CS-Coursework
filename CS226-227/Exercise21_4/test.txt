I had a friend one time who was having a disagreement with his girlfriend. We were out shooting some hoops and he was all intense and quiet, so I asked him what was up. I was sure a pick-up game of basketball didn't warrant that level of seriousness. Then he got into it. A day or two prior, she had been getting on him about his work schedule, and not spending time with her, and the fact that he never seemed like he wanted to talk. The conversation had quickly devolved into "you don't care about me" followed by him storming off and leaving.  He wasn't sure how to approach it, because he was putting in the extra hours to get her some nice jewelry for her birthday, which was like two weeks away, and he was angry that she didn't show him respect, instead choosing to scream at him that he didn't love her, which was obviously not true. 

After our class discussion yesterday, I picked out some key correlations. First, we guys were out doing something (shooting hoops), and he was all quiet. He was in his cave trying to process. He really loved this girl, and because he did, he was trying to do something nice for her, by getting her a status symbol object, like jewelry. I think guys tend to like status symbol objects, like diplomas on walls, or nice college rings, etc., because it helps in our careers. Thus he was putting in extra time at his job, which he really enjoyed. His girlfriend, on the other hand,  just wanted quality with him where they could talk, because she is more relationship-oriented. When she yelled at him, this hurt him even more, because he values respect. The fact that she yelled at him for doing something that he was ultimately doing for her made it even worse. I'm pretty sure that the only reason I remember this particular incident is because it made me appreciate my singleness.

I did understand that girls were more relationship-oriented, so I told him about that, and explained some possible remediation tactics, like a nice date dinner, or a morning coffee date. His natural response was "ugh", but he eventually went along with it, and they worked it out. He ended up explaining the respect thing to her, and she reiterated that she just wanted to spend time with him, rather than get stuff from him, so both sides came out okay in the end. I think the whole thing could have been avoided with proper communication from the get-go, but I'm glad they were eventually able to work things out in their own time.
